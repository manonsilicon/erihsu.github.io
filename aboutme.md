I am a Wireless Communication Chip Verification Engineering working at **Zeku Technology**, a startup SoC chip fabless in Shanghai, China. I have some experience in electronic design automation software development during my graduate student learning period from 2018-2021 at **SEU**. I am a fan of Rust programming language. I have written two parser, GDSII parser and tf-parser in Rust, which can be combined into in-house tools as file exchanger. Besides, I also use Python in my daily life.
